"""
This modules contains all the geometry need to make any kind of shape.
You can use directly the function ```regular_polygon``` and the transformations
like ```move```, ```rotate``` and ```scale``` to model your desired curve.

You can assemble JordanCurves to create shapes with holes,
or even unconnected shapes.
